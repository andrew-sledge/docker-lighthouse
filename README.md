# docker-lighthouse

A Docker image to run [Google's
Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/). I won't go
into all the features that Lighthouse has to offer, but I will say that it's
probably one of the best web performance tools aside from
[WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/). 

Please file PRs or issues if you see anything that needs to be added or changed.
